# Maui-seq_for_microbiome

This script is modification of the method described in MAUI-seq (Moeskjar et al. 2020 Mol Ecol Resour https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13294), aiming to simplify the process and enable its application to large-scale microbial community data. In this analysis, the amplified product profile in the sample is evaluated by counting the number of random sequence tags (unique molecular identifiers, UMIs) incorporated into the primers that are observed in a particular amplified product.

## MAUI_main.py
This script serves as a simple executable file that imports the "MAUI_modules.py" module.

The usage of this script is as follows:

```python MAUI_main.py MAUI_config.ini```

## MAUI_modules.py


## MAUI_config.ini
